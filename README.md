Heart disease prediction using machine learning involves building a model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical indicators. First, the dataset is loaded and preprocessed, which may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The dataset is then split into training and test sets to evaluate model performance. Common machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained on the training data. After training, the models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score using the test data. The model with the best performance is selected for heart disease prediction. This process can be enhanced further by fine-tuning model hyperparameters or exploring other algorithms. By using machine learning, healthcare professionals can have an automated tool to assist in diagnosing heart disease based on patient data.
